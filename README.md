# Timetable Management Website

##### (Note : This is new repo as old one had lots of college information)

This was my internship project where you can create and edit timetable.
You can visually edit it as well.
There is another feature where you can see the timetable.

# Flask Based

This website has flask based backend and use jinja templating for creating dynamic website
Flask is python based backend like we have express for MERN.

## Installation and Running Setup

First create virtual env

     python -m venv .env

Next is we open that .env file

I am using git bash:

    . .venv/Scripts/Activate

and then we have to install

    pip install -r requirements.txt

and now

    flask --app app.py --debug run

and now there you will see url and just open it in browser
